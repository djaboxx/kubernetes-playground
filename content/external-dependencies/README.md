# External Dependencies in Kubernetes Cluster Templates

This document explains what external tools we use in our Kubernetes clusters, how we use them now, and how we can make them better. Written in plain language for easier understanding.

## Core External Dependencies

### 1. ArgoCD
**What We Have Now:**
- Basic ArgoCD setup with single replicas
- Using standard default configuration
- Simple RBAC with basic role separation
- Git repositories configured manually
- Applications defined through plain YAML files

**What's Working Well:**
- Successful GitOps workflow for deployments
- Basic application synchronization working reliably
- Integration with our Git repositories
- Basic health monitoring of applications

**What We Could Do Better:**
- Set up proper High Availability (HA) with multiple replicas
- Implement application controller sharding for better performance
- Use ApplicationSets for template-based application creation
- Add better monitoring with Prometheus metrics
- Implement stricter RBAC with:
  - Team-based access control
  - Project-based isolation
  - Custom roles for different responsibilities

### 2. Cert-Manager
**What We Have Now:**
- Basic cert-manager installation from Helm charts
- Simple ClusterIssuer configurations
- Default certificate request handling

**What's Working Well:**
- Automatic certificate issuance
- Basic renewal process functioning
- Integration with common certificate authorities

**What We Could Do Better:**
- Add monitoring for certificate expiration
- Implement automatic rotation of secrets
- Set up alerts for failed certificate requests
- Use proper rate limiting for certificate requests
- Configure backup ClusterIssuers for failover
- Add metrics collection for certificate management

### 3. External DNS
**What We Have Now:**
- Basic DNS provider integration
- Simple record management
- Default configuration settings

**What's Working Well:**
- Basic DNS record synchronization
- Support for common DNS record types
- Integration with our DNS provider

**What We Could Do Better:**
- Add proper monitoring of DNS changes
- Implement retry mechanisms with backoff
- Set up proper ownership records
- Add validation for DNS record changes
- Configure proper TTL management
- Implement proper cleanup of stale records

### 4. Authentication
**What We Have Now:**
- Basic OAuth2 setup
- Simple user authentication flow
- Default session management

**What's Working Well:**
- Basic authentication process
- Integration with identity provider
- Session handling

**What We Could Do Better:**
- Implement proper audit logging
- Add multi-factor authentication
- Set up proper session management with:
  - Configurable timeouts
  - Proper token rotation
  - Session invalidation
- Add proper rate limiting
- Implement IP-based restrictions
- Set up proper monitoring of auth failures

## Current Implementation Details

### Infrastructure as Code
Our current setup uses:
- Terraform for infrastructure provisioning
- Helm charts for application deployment
- Kustomize for environment-specific configs

### Monitoring and Logging
Current setup includes:
- Basic application metrics
- Standard Kubernetes logs
- Simple alert rules

### Security Controls
We currently have:
- Basic network policies
- Simple RBAC rules
- Default security contexts

## Recommended Next Steps

1. High Availability Improvements:
   - Deploy multiple replicas of critical components
   - Set up proper leader election
   - Implement proper failover mechanisms
   - Configure resource requests/limits properly

2. Security Enhancements:
   - Implement network policies for all components
   - Set up proper secret rotation
   - Configure security contexts for all pods
   - Add pod security policies
   - Implement proper service account management

3. Monitoring Upgrades:
   - Add Prometheus metrics for all components
   - Set up proper alerting rules
   - Implement logging aggregation
   - Create useful dashboards
   - Add proper error tracking

4. Automation Improvements:
   - Implement automated testing
   - Set up proper CI/CD pipelines
   - Add automated rollbacks
   - Configure automated scaling
   - Set up proper backup procedures

## Action Plan

1. Week 1-2: ArgoCD Improvements

   - Configure proper RBAC
   - Set up ApplicationSets
   - Add monitoring

2. Week 3-4: Cert-Manager Enhancements
   - Add certificate monitoring
   - Set up automated rotation
   - Configure proper alerts
   - Implement metrics

3. Week 5-6: External DNS Updates
   - Add change monitoring
   - Implement proper validation
   - Configure cleanup jobs
   - Set up proper retry logic

4. Week 7-8: Authentication Upgrades
   - Add audit logging
   - Implement MFA
   - Set up proper session management
   - Configure rate limiting

This plan focuses on gradual improvements while maintaining system stability. Each phase includes testing and validation before moving to production.
