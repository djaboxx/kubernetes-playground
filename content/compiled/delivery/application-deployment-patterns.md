# Application Deployment Patterns

## Overview
Application deployment patterns are strategies used to deploy new versions of applications with minimal downtime and risk. These patterns help ensure smooth transitions between application versions and provide mechanisms for testing and validating new releases.

## Blue-Green Deployment
Blue-Green Deployment is a pattern where two identical environments (blue and green) are maintained. Traffic is switched between the two environments to minimize downtime during deployments.

### Key Concepts
- **Blue Environment**: The current production environment.
- **Green Environment**: The new environment where the new version of the application is deployed.
- **Traffic Switching**: The process of switching traffic from the blue environment to the green environment.

### Example
1. Deploy the new version of the application to the green environment.
2. Test the new version in the green environment.
3. Switch traffic from the blue environment to the green environment.
4. Monitor the new version for any issues.
5. If issues are found, switch traffic back to the blue environment.

### Benefits
- Minimal downtime during deployments.
- Easy rollback to the previous version if issues are found.

### Drawbacks
- Requires maintaining two identical environments, which can be resource-intensive.

## Canary Deployment
Canary Deployment is a pattern where a new version of an application is gradually rolled out to a small subset of users before being rolled out to the entire user base.

### Key Concepts
- **Canary Release**: The new version of the application that is deployed to a small subset of users.
- **Gradual Rollout**: The process of gradually increasing the number of users who receive the new version.

### Example
1. Deploy the new version of the application to a small subset of users (canary release).
2. Monitor the canary release for any issues.
3. Gradually increase the number of users who receive the new version.
4. If issues are found, stop the rollout and revert to the previous version.

### Benefits
- Allows for early detection of issues with the new version.
- Reduces the risk of widespread issues affecting all users.

### Drawbacks
- Requires careful monitoring and management of the rollout process.

## Rolling Deployment
Rolling Deployment is a pattern where a new version of an application is gradually rolled out to all users, replacing the old version incrementally.

### Key Concepts
- **Incremental Rollout**: The process of gradually replacing instances of the old version with instances of the new version.
- **Zero Downtime**: The goal of maintaining application availability during the deployment process.

### Example
1. Deploy the new version of the application to a small number of instances.
2. Monitor the new instances for any issues.
3. Gradually replace the remaining instances with the new version.
4. If issues are found, stop the rollout and revert the affected instances to the previous version.

### Benefits
- Minimal downtime during deployments.
- Allows for gradual validation of the new version.

### Drawbacks
- Requires careful monitoring and management of the rollout process.
