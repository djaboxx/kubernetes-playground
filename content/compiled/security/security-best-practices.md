# Security Best Practices

## Network Policies
Network policies are used to control the traffic flow between pods in a Kubernetes cluster. They help to enforce security boundaries and limit communication to only what is necessary.

### Example Network Policy
```yaml
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: NetworkPolicy
metadata:
  name: allow-specific-traffic
  namespace: default
spec:
  podSelector:
    matchLabels:
      app: my-app
  policyTypes:
  - Ingress
  - Egress
  ingress:
  - from:
    - podSelector:
        matchLabels:
          app: my-app
    ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 80
  egress:
  - to:
    - podSelector:
        matchLabels:
          app: my-app
    ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 80
```

## RBAC (Role-Based Access Control)
RBAC is used to control access to resources in a Kubernetes cluster based on the roles of individual users or groups. It helps to enforce the principle of least privilege.

### Example RBAC Configuration
```yaml
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: Role
metadata:
  namespace: default
  name: pod-reader
rules:
- apiGroups: [""]
  resources: ["pods"]
  verbs: ["get", "watch", "list"]
---
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: RoleBinding
metadata:
  name: read-pods
  namespace: default
subjects:
- kind: User
  name: jane
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
roleRef:
  kind: Role
  name: pod-reader
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
```

## Secrets Management
Kubernetes Secrets are used to store and manage sensitive information, such as passwords, OAuth tokens, and SSH keys. They help to keep sensitive data secure and separate from application code.

### Example Secret
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: my-secret
  namespace: default
type: Opaque
data:
  username: YWRtaW4=  # base64 encoded value
  password: MWYyZDFlMmU2N2Rm  # base64 encoded value
```

## Pod Security Policies
Pod Security Policies are used to control the security settings applied to pods in a Kubernetes cluster. They help to enforce security best practices and prevent the deployment of insecure pods.

### Example Pod Security Policy
```yaml
apiVersion: policy/v1beta1
kind: PodSecurityPolicy
metadata:
  name: restricted
spec:
  privileged: false
  allowPrivilegeEscalation: false
  requiredDropCapabilities:
  - ALL
  volumes:
  - 'configMap'
  - 'emptyDir'
  - 'projected'
  - 'secret'
  - 'downwardAPI'
  - 'persistentVolumeClaim'
  hostNetwork: false
  hostIPC: false
  hostPID: false
  runAsUser:
    rule: 'MustRunAsNonRoot'
  seLinux:
    rule: 'RunAsAny'
  supplementalGroups:
    rule: 'MustRunAs'
    ranges:
    - min: 1
      max: 65535
  fsGroup:
    rule: 'MustRunAs'
    ranges:
    - min: 1
      max: 65535
```

## Regular Audits
Regularly audit your Kubernetes cluster to ensure compliance with security best practices and to identify potential vulnerabilities. Use tools like kube-bench and kube-hunter to perform security audits and identify weaknesses.

### Example Audit Tools
- **kube-bench**: Checks whether Kubernetes is deployed securely by running the checks documented in the CIS Kubernetes Benchmark.
- **kube-hunter**: Hunts for security weaknesses in Kubernetes clusters.
