# Architecture Overview

## Realworld Kubernetes Deployment Architecture

## Overview

Our Kubernetes deployment follows a production-grade architecture with multiple layers of infrastructure and security controls. This document provides a high-level overview of how all components work together.

## Cluster Design
Details on the overall design and structure of the cluster.

## Components
Information on the core components and their roles within the cluster.

## Networking
Explanation of the networking setup, including VPC and subnet configurations.

## Security
Overview of the security measures in place, such as network policies and access controls.

## Architecture Layers

### Infrastructure Layer
```
VPC Network
    ├── Primary Subnet (us-central1)
    ├── Secondary Pod IP Ranges
    └── Secondary Service IP Ranges

Identity & Security
    ├── Workload Identity
    ├── Cloud NAT
    └── Private Google Access
```

### Cluster Layer
```
GKE Cluster
    ├── Control Plane (Regional)
    │   └── Private Endpoint
    │
    ├── Node Pools
    │   ├── System Pool
    │   └── Workload Pools
    │
    └── Security Controls
        ├── Network Policies
        └── Binary Authorization
```

### Platform Layer
```
Core Services
    ├── cert-manager
    ├── ingress-nginx
    └── external-dns

Monitoring Stack
    ├── Datadog
    ├── Cloud Operations
    └── Custom Metrics

Security Tools
    └── Fairwinds Insights
```

## Key Design Decisions

### High Availability
- Regional cluster deployment
- Multi-zone node pools
- Load balancer configuration
- Redundant service deployment

### Security
- Private cluster architecture
- Workload identity implementation
- Network policy enforcement 
- Regular security scanning

### Scalability
- Horizontal pod autoscaling
- Node pool autoscaling
- Regional resource distribution
- Load balancing configuration

### Observability
- Comprehensive metrics collection
- Centralized logging
- Automated alerting
- Performance monitoring

## Deployment Flow

1. Infrastructure provisioning
2. Cluster deployment
3. Core services installation
4. Monitoring setup
5. Security tool deployment
6. Application workload deployment
