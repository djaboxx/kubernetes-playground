# Networking and Security Components

## VPC and Subnetworks

### Private VPC Configuration
The cluster uses Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) networking to provide:
- Isolated network environment
- Control over IP address ranges
- Custom routing rules
- Private access to Google Cloud services

### Why VPC Configuration Matters
- Secures internal cluster communication
- Enables fine-grained access control
- Allows for proper network segmentation
- Supports compliance requirements

## Load Balancing

### Internal Load Balancing
- Regional internal load balancers for internal services
- Automatic health checking
- Session affinity options
- Cross-zone load balancing

### External Load Balancing
- Global load balancers for public services
- SSL/TLS termination
- DDoS protection
- CDN integration capabilities

### Why Load Balancing is Critical
- Distributes traffic evenly across nodes
- Provides high availability
- Enables zero-downtime deployments
- Handles SSL/TLS termination at the edge

## Network Security

### Network Policies
- Pod-to-pod communication rules
- Namespace isolation
- Ingress/egress controls
- Protocol and port restrictions

### Cloud NAT
- Managed NAT gateway service
- Enables outbound internet access for private nodes
- Configurable IP allocation
- Automatic IP rotation

### Why Network Security Matters
- Protects against unauthorized access
- Implements defense in depth
- Maintains compliance requirements
- Enables secure communication patterns
