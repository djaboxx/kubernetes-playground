# Real-World Kubernetes Directory Guide

This guide explains what each folder in our real-world setup does. We'll break it down into simple parts that are easy to understand.

## Main Directories

### cluster/
This is where we set up our main Kubernetes cluster. Think of it as building the foundation of a house. It includes:
- The main Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) cluster setup
- Settings for how many computers (nodes) we want
- Security settings to keep our cluster safe
- Network settings for how computers talk to each other

### init-charts/
This directory contains the first things we install in our cluster, like:
- Certificate manager for security certificates
- Basic monitoring tools
- Core security settings
These are like the basic utilities you need when first moving into a house - electricity, water, etc.

### operational-charts/
This contains tools we use to run and manage our cluster daily, such as:
- Monitoring dashboards
- Log collection tools
- Performance tracking tools
Think of these as the maintenance tools you need to keep your house running smoothly.

### proxy/
This directory manages how outside traffic gets into our cluster. It includes:
- Rules for allowing traffic in and out
- Load balancing (spreading traffic evenly)
- Security rules for external access
It's like having a security guard at the entrance of a building.

### template-cluster/
This is our blueprint for creating new clusters. It contains:
- Standard cluster settings
- Basic security rules
- Network configuration
- Firewall settings
Think of it as a house blueprint that we can reuse to build similar houses.

### template-resources/
This holds templates for the basic things every cluster needs:
- ArgoCD setup for managing applications
- Certificate configurations
- Basic cluster resources
It's like a checklist of furniture and appliances every new house needs.

### network-roles/
This manages who can do what on the network:
- Network access permissions
- Security roles
- Network rule configurations
Think of it as setting up different keys for different rooms in a building.

### external-providers/
This manages connections to outside services:
- GitHub repository connections
- External service integrations
- Third-party tool configurations
It's like setting up relationships with utility companies for your house.

### resources/
This contains the actual resources running in the cluster:
- Application configurations
- Service setups
- GitHub repository settings
Think of it as the actual furniture and decorations in your house.

## How They Work Together

All these directories work together like different parts of a building:
1. `cluster` builds the foundation
2. `init-charts` sets up basic utilities
3. `template-cluster` and `template-resources` provide blueprints
4. `operational-charts` adds management tools
5. `proxy` controls the entrance
6. `network-roles` manages access
7. `external-providers` connects to outside services
8. `resources` contains the actual things running inside

Each part has its own job, but they all work together to create a complete, working system.
