# Observability with Prometheus and Grafana

This section covers the concepts and practices for implementing observability using Prometheus and Grafana.

## What is Prometheus?

Prometheus is an open-source monitoring and alerting toolkit designed for reliability and scalability. It collects and stores metrics as time series data.

## What is Grafana?

Grafana is an open-source platform for monitoring and observability. It provides a powerful and flexible dashboard for visualizing metrics collected by Prometheus.

## Key Features

- **Metrics Collection**: Collect metrics from various sources using Prometheus.
- **Alerting**: Set up alerting rules to notify you of issues in your system.
- **Dashboards**: Create and customize dashboards in Grafana to visualize your metrics.
- **Data Sources**: Integrate with various data sources, including Prometheus, Elasticsearch, and more.

## Getting Started with Prometheus and Grafana

1. **Install Prometheus**: Follow the [installation guide](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/installation/).
2. **Install Grafana**: Follow the [installation guide](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/installation/).
3. **Configure Data Sources**: Connect Prometheus as a data source in Grafana.
4. **Create Dashboards**: Create and customize dashboards to visualize your metrics.

For more detailed information, refer to the [Prometheus documentation](https://prometheus.io/docs/introduction/overview/) and [Grafana documentation](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/).

## Advanced Topics

### Advanced Prometheus Configuration

#### Custom Metrics and ServiceMonitors

```yaml
apiVersion: monitoring.coreos.com/v1
kind: ServiceMonitor
metadata:
  name: custom-app-monitor
  namespace: monitoring
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: custom-application
  endpoints:
  - port: metrics
    interval: 15s
```

#### Recording Rules for Performance

Recording rules help precompute frequently needed or computationally expensive expressions:

```yaml
apiVersion: monitoring.coreos.com/v1
kind: PrometheusRule
metadata:
  name: custom-recording-rules
  namespace: monitoring
spec:
  groups:
  - name: custom.rules
    rules:
    - record: job:http_requests_total:rate5m
      expr: rate(http_requests_total[5m])
```

### Advanced Grafana Features

#### Data Source Configuration

Best practices for configuring multiple data sources:
- Use provisioning for data sources
- Implement proper access controls
- Configure appropriate query timeouts
- Enable caching when applicable

#### Custom Dashboard Development

Tips for creating effective dashboards:
- Use template variables for reusability
- Implement consistent naming conventions
- Structure panels logically
- Utilize proper time intervals

#### Alert Configuration

Setting up sophisticated alerting rules:
```yaml
groups:
- name: example
  rules:
  - alert: HighErrorRate
    expr: |
      sum(rate(http_requests_total{status=~"5.."}[5m])) by (service)
      /
      sum(rate(http_requests_total[5m])) by (service)
      > 0.1
    for: 10m
    labels:
      severity: warning
    annotations:
      summary: High HTTP error rate for {{ $labels.service }}
      description: Error rate is {{ $value | humanizePercentage }} for the last 10 minutes
```

### Integration with Other Tools

#### Loki Integration
- Setting up Loki data source
- Correlating metrics with logs
- Creating combined dashboards

#### Tempo Integration
- Distributed tracing setup
- Trace to logs correlation
- Performance analysis

### Best Practices

1. **Resource Management**
   - Right-sizing Prometheus storage
   - Configuring retention policies
   - Managing dashboard permissions

2. **High Availability**
   - Implementing Prometheus HA
   - Load balancing considerations
   - Data replication strategies

3. **Security Considerations**
   - TLS configuration
   - Authentication setup
   - Authorization policies

## Operations and Monitoring Components

### Prometheus Server

The Prometheus server is responsible for scraping and storing metrics data. It uses a powerful query language called PromQL to retrieve and analyze metrics.

### Alertmanager

Alertmanager handles alerts sent by client applications such as the Prometheus server. It takes care of deduplicating, grouping, and routing them to the correct receiver integrations such as email, PagerDuty, or OpsGenie.

### Pushgateway

The Pushgateway is used to collect metrics from short-lived jobs. It allows ephemeral and batch jobs to expose their metrics to Prometheus.

### Node Exporter

Node Exporter is a Prometheus exporter for hardware and OS metrics exposed by *nix kernels. It allows you to measure various machine resources such as memory, disk, and CPU utilization.

### Grafana

Grafana is used for visualizing metrics stored in Prometheus. It provides a rich set of features for creating, exploring, and sharing dashboards.
