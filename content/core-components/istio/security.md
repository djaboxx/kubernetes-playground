# Istio Security Guide

## Authentication

### 1. Peer Authentication
Controls service-to-service authentication by enabling mutual TLS (mTLS) for secure communication between services.

### 2. Request Authentication
Validates JWT tokens for end-user authentication to ensure only authorized users can access services.

## Authorization

### Service-to-Service Authorization
Defines policies to control which services can communicate with each other and what actions they can perform.

## mTLS Configuration

### 1. Global mTLS
Enable mesh-wide mTLS to secure all service-to-service communication within the mesh.

### 2. Namespace-level mTLS
Configure mTLS for specific namespaces to provide flexibility in security settings.

## Security Best Practices

1. **Authentication**
   - Enable mTLS across the mesh
   - Use STRICT mode in production
   - Implement JWT validation for external traffic

2. **Authorization**
   - Follow principle of least privilege
   - Use namespace-level policies
   - Regularly audit policies

3. **Key Management**
   - Rotate certificates regularly
   - Monitor certificate expiration
   - Secure root CA credentials

## Implementation Steps

1. **Enable Security Features**
Verify mTLS status, check authentication policies, and verify authorization policies using `istioctl` and `kubectl` commands.

2. **Monitor Security**
Monitor proxy certificates, verify mTLS configuration, and debug authorization using `istioctl` commands.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Certificate Problems**
   - Expired certificates
   - Missing root certificates
   - Trust domain misconfigurations

2. **Authorization Failures**
   - Policy conflicts
   - RBAC misconfiguration
   - Selector mismatches

### Debug Commands
Use `istioctl` commands to check proxy certificates, verify policy enforcement, and test authorization policies.

## Security Monitoring

1. **Key Metrics to Watch**
   - mTLS connection success rate
   - Authentication failures
   - Authorization denials
   - Certificate rotation events

2. **Integration with Security Tools**
Integrate with SIEM systems, audit logging, and compliance monitoring tools to enhance security monitoring.
