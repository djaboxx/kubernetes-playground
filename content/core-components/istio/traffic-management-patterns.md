# Traffic Management Patterns with Istio

## Request Routing with User Context
One powerful pattern in Istio is routing traffic based on user context, which enables personalized experiences without changing application code.

### Example: User-Based Routing
```yaml
apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1alpha3
kind: VirtualService
metadata:
  name: reviews-route
spec:
  hosts:
  - reviews
  http:
  - match:
    - headers:
        end-user:
          exact: jason
    route:
    - destination:
        host: reviews
        subset: v2
  - route:
    - destination:
        host: reviews
        subset: v1
```

### Benefits
- **A/B Testing**: Route specific users to new features for beta testing
- **Gradual Rollouts**: Test new versions with trusted users first
- **Debugging**: Route specific users to debug versions for troubleshooting
- **VIP Features**: Provide premium features to specific user segments

## Canary Deployments
Istio enables sophisticated canary deployments without requiring application changes.

```yaml
apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1beta1
kind: VirtualService
metadata:
  name: automated-canary
spec:
  hosts:
  - app.example.com
  http:
  - route:
    - destination:
        host: app-primary
      weight: 90
    - destination:
        host: app-canary
      weight: 10
```

### Benefits
- **Risk Mitigation**: Gradually expose users to new versions
- **Real-World Validation**: Test with actual user traffic
- **Automatic Rollback**: Quick reversion if issues are detected
- **Performance Comparison**: Compare metrics between versions

## Security and Authentication

```yaml
apiVersion: security.istio.io/v1beta1
kind: PeerAuthentication
metadata:
  name: default
  namespace: istio-system
spec:
  mtls:
    mode: STRICT
```

### Benefits
- **Zero-Trust Security**: Automatic mTLS between services
- **Identity Verification**: Every service has a strong identity
- **Encryption by Default**: All traffic is encrypted without application changes
- **Compliance**: Meet security requirements with infrastructure controls

## Best Practices
1. Start with small traffic percentages for canary deployments
2. Use meaningful subset names that reflect version or purpose
3. Implement circuit breakers to prevent cascade failures
4. Monitor metrics during traffic shifts
5. Document routing rules for team visibility
