# Traffic Management with Istio

## Core Concepts

### Virtual Services
Virtual Services define how requests are routed to a service. They provide a way to configure traffic rules for how requests are handled.

### Destination Rules
Destination Rules define policies that apply to traffic intended for a service after routing has occurred.

## Traffic Management Patterns

### 1. Canary Deployments
Gradually roll out changes by routing a percentage of traffic to a new version to ensure stability and minimize risk.

### 2. Circuit Breaking
Prevent cascading failures by limiting the impact of failing services and isolating them from the rest of the system.

### 3. Fault Injection
Test service resilience by simulating failures and observing how the system responds.

## Best Practices

1. **Traffic Splitting**
   - Start with small percentages for new versions
   - Monitor error rates before increasing traffic
   - Have rollback procedures ready

2. **Resilience**
   - Always configure timeout and retry policies
   - Use circuit breakers for dependencies
   - Implement fallback mechanisms

3. **Performance**
   - Configure resource limits for sidecars
   - Use locality-aware load balancing
   - Monitor latency impact of policies

## Monitoring Traffic Flow

Use `istioctl` commands to view routing configuration, check proxy configuration, and visualize the service mesh with Kiali.

## Troubleshooting

1. **Common Issues**
   - Routing conflicts
   - Certificate errors
   - Performance degradation

2. **Debug Commands**
Use `kubectl` and `istioctl` commands to check proxy logs, verify configuration, and debug routing issues.
