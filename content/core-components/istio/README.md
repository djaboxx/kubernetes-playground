# Istio Service Mesh

## Overview
Istio is an open-source service mesh that provides a uniform way to connect, secure, control, and observe services in a Kubernetes cluster. It extends Kubernetes to establish a programmable, application-aware network using the powerful Envoy service proxy.

## Core Features
- **Traffic Management**: Intelligent routing and control of service-to-service communication
- **Security**: Automatic service-to-service and end-user authentication and authorization
- **Observability**: Detailed monitoring, logging, and tracing for all services
- **Platform Support**: Runs on any Kubernetes cluster, on-premises or cloud

## Architecture Components
1. **Control Plane**
   - istiod (Pilot, Citadel, Galley combined)
   - Configuration API server
   - Certificate authority

2. **Data Plane**
   - Envoy proxies (sidecars)
   - Ingress/Egress gateways

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Kubernetes cluster 1.21+
- Helm 3.x
- kubectl configured

### Basic Installation
To install Istio, download the Istio package, add `istioctl` to your path, and install Istio with the demo profile. For production installations, use Helm to install the base chart, istiod, and ingress gateway.

## Sidecar Injection
Enable automatic sidecar injection for a namespace by labeling the namespace with `istio-injection=enabled`.
