# Observability Patterns with Istio

## Distributed Tracing Integration

### Jaeger Setup
```yaml
apiVersion: install.istio.io/v1alpha1
kind: IstioOperator
spec:
  components:
    tracing:
      enabled: true
  values:
    global:
      tracer:
        zipkin:
          address: jaeger-collector.observability:9411
```

### Benefits
- **Request Flow Visualization**: See the complete path of requests across services
- **Performance Bottleneck Detection**: Identify slow services in your mesh
- **Error Chain Analysis**: Trace the origin of failures through service calls
- **Service Dependency Mapping**: Automatically document service relationships

## Adaptive Sampling

### Configuration Options
1. **Rate Limiting**: Control the number of traces collected
2. **Conditional Sampling**: Trace specific paths or conditions
3. **Probabilistic Sampling**: Sample a percentage of traffic

### Benefits
- **Cost Control**: Manage storage and processing costs
- **Focus on Important Traffic**: Capture relevant traces
- **Performance Impact Management**: Minimize overhead in production

## Metrics and Monitoring

### Key Metrics
1. **Golden Signals**:
   - Latency
   - Traffic
   - Errors
   - Saturation

2. **Mesh-Specific Metrics**:
   - mTLS connection rates
   - Proxy resource usage
   - Control plane health

### Benefits
- **Proactive Issue Detection**: Catch problems before they affect users
- **Capacity Planning**: Make data-driven scaling decisions
- **SLO Monitoring**: Track service level objectives
- **Security Monitoring**: Detect unusual traffic patterns

## Best Practices
1. Start with higher sampling rates and adjust based on volume
2. Set up retention policies for trace data
3. Use consistent span naming conventions
4. Tag traces with business-relevant metadata
5. Configure appropriate trace sampling for different environments
