# Istio Production Best Practices

## Resource Planning

### 1. Control Plane Sizing
Plan resource allocation for the control plane, including CPU and memory requests and limits.

### 2. Data Plane Optimization
Optimize data plane resources, proxy concurrency, and protocol detection timeouts.

## High Availability Configuration

### 1. Multi-cluster Setup
Configure multi-cluster setups for high availability and fault tolerance.

### 2. Fault Tolerance Settings
Implement fault tolerance settings to handle connection pool limits and outlier detection.

## Security Hardening

1. **Network Policies**
   - Implement strict namespace isolation
   - Control egress traffic
   - Secure control plane access

2. **Certificate Management**
   - Regular rotation schedule
   - Monitoring expiration
   - Backup procedures

## Performance Tuning

### 1. Gateway Optimization
Optimize gateway configurations for performance and security.

### 2. Sidecar Resource Limits
Set resource limits for sidecars to ensure efficient resource usage.

## Monitoring and Alerting

### 1. Critical Metrics
Monitor control plane health, data plane connectivity, certificate expiration, and resource utilization.

### 2. SLO Definitions
Define service level objectives (SLOs) for key metrics.

## Disaster Recovery

### 1. Backup Procedures
Backup control plane configuration, custom resources, certificates, and mesh configuration.

### 2. Recovery Steps
Outline recovery steps to restore Istio components and validate mesh connectivity.

## Upgrade Strategy

### 1. Canary Upgrades
Test upgrades in a development environment, upgrade the control plane first, and perform rolling updates for data plane proxies.

### 2. Rollback Plan
Define rollback procedures to revert to previous versions if needed.

## Capacity Planning

### 1. Scaling Thresholds
Set thresholds for CPU utilization, memory usage, connection pool saturation, and request queue depth.

### 2. Growth Planning
Plan for traffic growth, resource reservation, cluster expansion, and multi-cluster considerations.
