# Core Components

This section covers the essential components that form the foundation of our Kubernetes infrastructure:

1. [Argo CD](argo-cd/README.md) - GitOps continuous delivery
2. [Cert-Manager](cert-manager/README.md) - Certificate management
3. [Ingress NGINX](ingress-nginx/README.md) - Ingress controller
4. [Prometheus Stack](prometheus/README.md) - Monitoring and alerting

Each component plays a crucial role in creating a production-ready Kubernetes environment. Start with the component that best matches your current needs, or follow them in order for a complete platform setup.
