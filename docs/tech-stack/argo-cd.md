# Argo CD

## What is Argo CD?

Argo CD is a tool for continuous delivery in Kubernetes. It helps automate the deployment of applications by ensuring that the applications in the cluster are always in sync with the code in the Git repository.

## Best Practices

1. **Use GitOps principles:** Store your application configurations in Git repositories and use Argo CD to manage the deployment.
2. **Automate deployments:** Set up automated pipelines to deploy applications whenever there are changes in the Git repository.
3. **Monitor application health:** Use Argo CD's monitoring features to keep an eye on the health of your applications.

## Security Concerns

1. **Access control:** Use role-based access control (RBAC) to manage who can deploy and manage applications.
2. **Secrets management:** Use Kubernetes secrets to store sensitive information and ensure they are encrypted.
3. **Audit logs:** Enable audit logging to keep track of who made changes to the applications and when.

## How to Deploy Argo CD with Terraform

1. **Install Terraform:** Make sure you have Terraform installed on your machine. You can download it from [Terraform's website](https://www.terraform.io/downloads).
2. **Create a Terraform configuration file:** Create a file named `main.tf` and add the following configuration:

```hcl
provider "kubernetes" {
  config_path = "~/.kube/config"
}

resource "kubernetes_namespace" "argocd" {
  metadata {
    name = "argocd"
  }
}

resource "kubernetes_deployment" "argocd_server" {
  metadata {
    name      = "argocd-server"
    namespace = kubernetes_namespace.argocd.metadata[0].name
  }

  spec {
    replicas = 1

    selector {
      match_labels = {
        app = "argocd-server"
      }
    }

    template {
      metadata {
        labels = {
          app = "argocd-server"
        }
      }

      spec {
        container {
          name  = "argocd-server"
          image = "argoproj/argocd:v2.0.0"

          port {
            container_port = 8080
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

3. **Apply the configuration:** Run the following command to apply the configuration and deploy Argo CD:

```sh
terraform init
terraform apply
```

This will create a namespace for Argo CD and deploy the Argo CD server in your Kubernetes cluster.
