# Cert Manager

## What is Cert Manager?

Cert Manager is a tool for managing certificates in Kubernetes. It automates the creation, renewal, and management of TLS certificates, making it easier to secure applications with HTTPS.

## Best Practices

1. **Automate certificate renewal:** Set up Cert Manager to automatically renew certificates before they expire.
2. **Use Let's Encrypt:** Use Let's Encrypt as the certificate issuer for free and automated SSL/TLS certificates.
3. **Monitor certificate status:** Regularly check the status of your certificates to ensure they are valid and not close to expiration.

## Security Concerns

1. **Secure certificate storage:** Ensure that certificates and private keys are stored securely and are not accessible to unauthorized users.
2. **Use strong encryption:** Use strong encryption algorithms for your certificates to enhance security.
3. **Regularly update Cert Manager:** Keep Cert Manager up to date to benefit from the latest security patches and features.

## How to Deploy Cert Manager with Terraform

1. **Install Terraform:** Make sure you have Terraform installed on your machine. You can download it from [Terraform's website](https://www.terraform.io/downloads).
2. **Create a Terraform configuration file:** Create a file named `main.tf` and add the following configuration:

```hcl
provider "kubernetes" {
  config_path = "~/.kube/config"
}

resource "kubernetes_namespace" "cert-manager" {
  metadata {
    name = "cert-manager"
  }
}

resource "kubernetes_deployment" "cert_manager" {
  metadata {
    name      = "cert-manager"
    namespace = kubernetes_namespace.cert-manager.metadata[0].name
  }

  spec {
    replicas = 1

    selector {
      match_labels = {
        app = "cert-manager"
      }
    }

    template {
      metadata {
        labels = {
          app = "cert-manager"
        }
      }

      spec {
        container {
          name  = "cert-manager"
          image = "quay.io/jetstack/cert-manager-controller:v1.0.0"

          port {
            container_port = 9402
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

3. **Apply the configuration:** Run the following command to apply the configuration and deploy Cert Manager:

```sh
terraform init
terraform apply
```

This will create a namespace for Cert Manager and deploy the Cert Manager controller in your Kubernetes cluster.
