# Helm Fundamentals

## What is Helm?
Helm is a package manager for Kubernetes that helps you define, install, and upgrade even the most complex Kubernetes applications.

## Key Concepts

### Chart
A Helm package that contains all the resource definitions necessary to run an application or service inside a Kubernetes cluster.

### Release
An instance of a chart running in a Kubernetes cluster.

### Repository
A place where charts can be collected and shared.

## Additional Details and Examples

### Chart
A Helm chart is a collection of files that describe a related set of Kubernetes resources. It includes templates that generate Kubernetes manifests, which are YAML-formatted resource descriptions that Kubernetes can understand. Charts can be used to deploy applications, services, and other components in a Kubernetes cluster. They can be versioned, shared, and reused, making it easier to manage complex deployments.

Example:
```yaml
# Chart.yaml
apiVersion: v2
name: mychart
description: A Helm chart for Kubernetes
version: 0.1.0
```

### Release
A release is a running instance of a chart, combined with a specific configuration. When you install a chart, Helm creates a new release. Each release is identified by a unique name and can be upgraded, rolled back, or deleted independently of other releases.

Example:
```sh
# Install a chart and create a release
helm install myrelease mychart
```

### Repository
A Helm repository is a collection of charts that can be shared and accessed by others. Repositories can be hosted on various platforms, including GitHub, Google Cloud Storage, and Amazon S3. Helm provides commands to add, update, and search repositories, making it easy to discover and use charts from different sources.

Example:
```sh
# Add a repository
helm repo add myrepo https://example.com/charts

# Update the repository
helm repo update

# Search for charts in the repository
helm search repo myrepo
```
