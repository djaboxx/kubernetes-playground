# Git Repository Dependencies

## Current Repository Structure

### 1. ArgoCD Image Updater
The template currently relies on ArgoCD Image Updater for automated image updates. Key dependencies:

- Docker Hub
- Google Container Registry (GCR)
- GitHub Container Registry
- GitHub Docker Packages
- RedHat Quay

Best practices suggest implementing proper authentication and rate limiting for each registry.

### 2. GitHub Integration

Current setup includes:
- GitHub repository connections
- Branch management
- File configurations
- Repository webhooks

## Version Management

### 1. Supported Versions

The templates currently support:
- Kubernetes: 1.24+
- ArgoCD: 2.x
- Helm: 3.x
- Vault: 1.12+
- Terraform: 1.0+
- Cert-Manager: 1.8+
- Prometheus: 2.x
- Grafana: 9.x

### 2. Version Control Best Practices

#### Git Repository Structure
```
repo/
  ├── environments/
  │   ├── dev/
  │   ├── staging/
  │   └── prod/
  ├── base/
  │   ├── applications/
  │   └── infrastructure/
  └── charts/
      └── custom/
```

#### Version Pinning
- Use explicit versions for all dependencies
- Avoid using 'latest' tags
- Document version compatibility matrix
- Implement version upgrade strategy

## Current Gaps

1. Version Control
   - Missing explicit version pins in some configurations
   - Inconsistent version management across environments
   - Need better version upgrade strategy

2. Repository Structure
   - Some configurations mixed between application and infrastructure
   - Need better separation of concerns
   - Missing clear ownership definitions

3. CI/CD Integration
   - Need better integration with CI/CD pipelines
   - Missing automated testing for version upgrades
   - Need better release management process

## Recommendations

1. Version Management
   - Implement strict version pinning
   - Create version compatibility matrix
   - Document upgrade paths
   - Set up automated version checking

2. Repository Organization
   - Separate application and infrastructure code
   - Implement clear ownership model
   - Use proper branching strategy
   - Implement proper code review process

3. CI/CD Improvements
   - Add automated testing for version compatibility
   - Implement automated upgrade testing
   - Add release automation
   - Implement proper rollback procedures

## Action Items

1. Repository Structure
   - Reorganize repository structure
