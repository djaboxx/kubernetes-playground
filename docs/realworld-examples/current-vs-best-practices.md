# Current Practices vs Best Practices in Our Kubernetes Setup

## How We Set Up Our Clusters

### What We're Doing Now
We use Terraform to create our Kubernetes clusters on Google Cloud (GKE). Here's what this means:

1. **Base Setup**
   - We create clusters using template files
   - Each cluster gets its own virtual network
   - We use basic security settings
   - We configure simple monitoring

2. **Application Management**
   - We use ArgoCD to deploy applications
   - Apps are managed through Git repositories
   - Basic security rules control who can do what
   - Simple monitoring tracks how things are running

### What We Could Do Better

1. **Security Improvements**
   - Add stronger network rules
   - Use better secret management
   - Add more detailed access controls
   - Set up better monitoring and alerts

2. **High Availability**
   - Run important services in multiple places
   - Add automatic recovery when things fail
   - Create better backup systems
   - Test disaster recovery regularly

3. **Monitoring and Management**
   - Add more detailed monitoring
   - Create better alert systems
   - Improve logging
   - Make troubleshooting easier

## Our Tools and How We Use Them

### ArgoCD
**Current Setup:**
- Basic installation without high availability
- Simple project structure
- Basic RBAC (role-based access control)
- Manual secret management

**How to Improve:**
- Add high availability setup
- Create better project organization
- Add stronger access controls
- Use better secret management
- Add automated recovery

### Cert-Manager
**Current Setup:**
- Basic certificate management
- Manual certificate renewal
- Simple monitoring

**How to Improve:**
- Add automatic certificate renewal
- Set up expiration alerts
- Add better certificate tracking
- Improve security measures
- Add backup certificates

### External DNS
**Current Setup:**
- Basic DNS management
- Manual updates
- Simple configuration

**How to Improve:**
- Add automatic DNS updates
- Set up better monitoring
- Add error checking
- Improve security
- Create backup systems

## Making Things Work Together

### Current Integration
1. **GitOps Flow**
   - Basic Git repository setup
   - Simple deployment process
   - Manual version control
   - Basic change tracking

2. **Security**
   - Basic network rules
   - Simple access controls
   - Manual secret handling
   - Basic monitoring

### Better Integration
1. **Improved GitOps**
   - Better repository organization
   - Automated deployments
   - Strict version control
   - Detailed change tracking

2. **Enhanced Security**
   - Strong network rules
   - Detailed access controls
   - Automated secret rotation
   - Comprehensive monitoring

## Step-by-Step Improvements

1. **First Steps**
   - Add high availability to critical services
   - Improve basic security
   - Set up better monitoring
   - Create better documentation

2. **Next Steps**
   - Add automated recovery
   - Improve secret management
   - Set up better alerts
   - Create disaster recovery plans

3. **Advanced Steps**
   - Add full automation
   - Implement zero-trust security
   - Create comprehensive monitoring
   - Set up automatic scaling
